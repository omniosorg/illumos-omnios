# AArch64 Project Documentation

This directory holds documentation on the AArch64 port intended to serve as an
annex to
(IPD 24 Support for 64-bit ARM (AArch64)[https://github.com/illumos/ipd/blob/master/ipd/0024/README.md]

That is easier to update in real time along with source changes, and more
appropriate than dropping a full set of project information into the IPD.
